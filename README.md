# Void Fest PWA

This website provides the possibility to send push notification which informs about the next band which will play on the music festival [Void Fest](www.voidfest.de).

This frontend communicates with this [Node.js backend](https://github.com/Mokkapps/void-fest-pwa-server) to be able to subscribe for certain push notification topics.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
